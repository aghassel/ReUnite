<!-- Mission Statment: ReConnect -->
## Mission Statement: ReConnect

At ReUnite wish to create a sustainable network that provides resources needed to refugees while optimizing resources, money, and quality of human life. ReUnite uses ai recognition software to verify refugees when they reach a camp so that we can use an extensive database to help them find their families, get resources catered to them, and find new homes. As refugees relocate smart contracts via Ethereum will be used to create easy-to-understand, translatable, contracts that refugee sponsors and refugees can fully understand.  We wish to create an optimized cycle where the most lives are saved, and the right resources are given to those in need.

## Introduction

Around 82.4 million people around the world have been destabilized and forced from their homes. Half of these are under the age of eighteen. Our goal is to help these people find a new home and get the support they need. Many of these people left their homes with nothing looking for a better future. At ReConnect were aiming to make the transition into a new country as easy as possible for these people. By gathering all the information about refugees, we allow a more efficient and easier way to connect these refugees with potential lost family members, sponsors, and support groups aimed at helping them. Using large databases and working with international organizations and countries we aim to connect and identify refugees who may not have any form of identification or support network. The government of Canada has a refugee sponsorship program, but there is no matrix to choose your preference and or how many people you can house. A more versatile interface for both users will encourage more people to come to the program. Our software aims to reduce the time taken to find a sponsor as well as create a system that finds the best match for the families based on their preferences and needs.

## Verification
> When refugees are first admitted they get a facial scan, and fingerprint scan and all the information that they are willing to give is collected to make a profile. The reliability of the facial recognition will be ensured by changing the background to increase the contrast when taking pictures with people with darker skin pigmentation.

> The Facial recognition software implements the Microsoft Azure Face API that delivers a state-of-the-art, low friction classification model. The Face API is highly secured and does not store any of the user data. It relies on enterprise-grade security and privacy applied to both the data and trained model. The facial data is compared with the government’s citizen image database, which is protected by external privacy measures. 

>	Once a profile is formed for the individual or family, they are put into multiple organizations in order to find to go thorough databases and find potential family members. Uses international databases such as Interpol to find and connected families based in different places or even in different refugee camps. There is no official processing time for OYW applications, and it can often take more than a year for the family members to arrive. The family members coming through OYW will have to complete an IMM 6000 package similar to what the principal applicant completed to come to Canada. This process is meant to make the process more efficient and reduce the time taken for family reunification.

## Get Resources:

We aim to help the refugees find resources to help their relocation and potentially gain valuable aid. We go through the database of refugees and are grouped into different categories based on their needs and situation. This allows for us to match them with organizations looking to help and take away the need for direct contact as it might be hard to do considering the situation of many refugees. This also reduced the chances of corruption or exploitation as we ensure the organization helping the refugees are not predatory. These also reduce resources wasted as it ensures everyone gets on the resources they need and not general aid that might not help them in their situation.

## Find a Home 

Our website allows potential sponsors to apply for our program. It vets the potential sponsors and their available resources and matches them with potential refugees. The sponsors that have been through the background check can now choose from a pool of potential refugees and allow for a needs-based match. The private sponsorship of refugees in Canada has allowed Canadians to welcome more than 327,000 refugees since it was established in 1979. Over the past ten years, the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program accounted for over 50 percent of resettled refugee arrivals in Canada. Our system allows for a smoother transition with sponsor families and allows refugees to be reinstalled sooner, reducing the need for permanent refugee settlements. In addition, the finalized contracts that are being used are encrypted Smart Contracts via the blockchain that allow for a smooth and easy agreement that is accessible to all and easy to understand.

## Marketing Strategy/Stakeholders 

The stakeholders in this project are refugees, international refugee support organizations, countries housing refugees, and sponsors for refugees. The ease of use of the software and the website as well as the transparency will allow people to trust the data. Our goal is to partner with different organizations to make the relocation of the refugees faster and easier for all.

## Next Steps in the Future 

>	After developing a UI using HTML and CSS for the website, the next steps would be partnering with NGOs, international organizations, and governments to be able to cooperate with them and use their database. The system can further be used to also help rescue victims of earthquakes and other natural disasters displaced.

>	Planning to create a 3d facial recognition model to get the most detail with colour saturation and auto-brightness adjustments ensuring everyone's details are gathered properly.
